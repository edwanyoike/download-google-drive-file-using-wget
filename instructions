download file from google drive using terminal (wget)

1. right click on the file to get a shareable link

#example of a shareable link
 https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Hj3j8QWVCiEIET1pgVaErB2TDyjccQYD

2. note the id param 1Hj3j8QWVCiEIET1pgVaErB2TDyjccQYD
    
3. in the command below which you will later paste to terminal replace ID with the value you noted above

4. after -O is where you specify with what name the file should be saved. in this case I have given the file the name
    pictures.zip .. change it accordingly.

5. paste the command on the terminal after all the replacement.
6. watch the progress bar :-)
